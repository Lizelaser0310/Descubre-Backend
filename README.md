## General Information

### **Problem**
<p align="justify">The lack of vocational orientation in young people in the pre-university stage can be attributed to the problem of choosing a career that is not in accordance with their interests, abilities and aptitudes. An erroneous career decision could lead to various problems in the course of the decision-maker's personal, university and work life, such as desertion, poor university performance, work frustration, repercussions on physical health, stress, anxiety, poor work performance, feelings of failure and personal dissatisfaction.</p>

### **Objectives**
<p align="justify">The objective of this project is to develop a vocational guidance application with web technologies, based on psychometric tests of vocational preferences, aptitudes and behavioral profile, with the purpose of supporting pre-university students in the choice of a university or technical career.</p>
